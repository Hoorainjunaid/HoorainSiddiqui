          <h2> Here's a shorter version of Cinderella's story:</h2>

          <p><h3>Cinderella was a kind and beautiful girl who lived with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters. They made her do all the work while they enjoyed themselves. One day, the prince announced a grand ball, and every maiden in the kingdom was invited. Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters went, leaving her behind.

Cinderella's fairy godmother magically appeared, giving her a beautiful dress and glass slippers so she could attend the ball. At the ball, Cinderella captivated the prince, but she had to leave before midnight when the magic wore off. She rushed home, leaving one glass slipper behind.

The prince searched for Cinderella, using the glass slipper to find her. When he did, they were reunited, and he made her his bride. Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after.

This story teaches us about kindness, perseverance, and the belief that dreams can come true.</h3> </p>
